# flickr-with-uploads

115-line Node.js wrapper for the Flickr API, using oAuth authentication, supporting uploads.

It currently supports only Flickr's "API Methods" (on the right side of the page [Flickr API Documentation](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)), and [Uploading](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/upload.api.html).

A pull request is in the process, to ciaranj's `node-oauth`, for some required functionality to allow signing but not GET/POSTing with that oAuth library. For the time being, this package requires my `node-oauth` fork, which includes that functionality.

The library is forked from [node-flickr](https://github.com/sujal/node-flickr), but I pretty much rewrote the whole flickr.js file. I fixed the formatting, simplified the signing or not-signing handling, and **most importantly** now support uploading. Even though I added a pretty big feature, I decreased the line count from 158 to 115.
[node-flickr](https://github.com/sujal/node-flickr), in turn, is heavily inspired by [the flickrnode library by Ciaran Jessup](https://github.com/ciaranj/flickrnode).

## Initialization

Install the library into your package.json file or using the following command:

    npm install flickr-with-uploads

And then require it like so:

````javascript
var Flickr = require('flickr-with-uploads').Flickr;

// constructor arguments: new Flickr(consumer_key, consumer_secret, oauth_token, oauth_token_secret, base_url)
var client = new Flickr('0RjUImXvsYx2P8Gi4eZScFh9fkLJltDV', 'mbu87dOB0FWncTRJ',
  '3XF0pqP4daZf9oIlx-a7H1uMLeGrBidkJU', 'KpslBxHoh4QYk6ad')
````

I read in options from a `.env` file like so, but you can do it however you want:

````javascript
function readOptions(callback) {
  fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, '.env'), 'utf8', function(err, text) {
    var opts = {};
    if (!err) {
      text.split(/\n/).forEach(function(line) {
        var line_parts = line.split(/\=/);
        opts[line_parts[0]] = line_parts[1];
      });
    }
    callback(err, opts);
  });
}
````

And my .env file (all my values are fake, obviously--actual credentials are all hexadecimal):

    FLICKR_API_KEY=0RjUImXvsYx2P8Gi4eZScFh9fkLJltDV
    FLICKR_API_SECRET=mbu87dOB0FWncTRJ
    FLICKR_OA_TOKEN=3XF0pqP4daZf9oIlx-a7H1uMLeGrBidkJU
    FLICKR_OA_TOKEN_SECRET=KpslBxHoh4QYk6ad

And then since all my calls are signed, I wrote a helper function, `api`:

````javascript
function api(method_name, data, callback) {
  // overloaded as (method_name, data, callback)
  return client.createRequest(method_name, data, true, callback).send();
}
````

## Examples

Using my `api` function from above:

````javascript
var fullpath = '/Users/chbrown/Pictures/Seaworld - The Heist/orca_019.jpg';
var params = {
  title: 'My new pet: baby orca', description: "Don't tell Seaworld!",
  is_public: 0, is_friend: 1, is_family: 1, hidden: 2,
  photo: fs.createReadStream(fullpath, {flags: 'r'})
};
// the method_name gets the special value of "upload" for uploads.
api('upload', params, function(err, response) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Could not upload photo:", err.toString());
  }
  else {
    // usually, the method name is precisely the name of the API method, as they are here:
    api('flickr.photos.getInfo', {photo_id: response.photoid}, function(err, response) {
      api('flickr.photosets.addPhoto', {photoset_id: 1272356126, photo_id: response.photo.id}, function(err) {
        console.log("Full photo info:", response.photo);
      });
    });
  }
});
````

## Flickr API Examples

Here are some sample responses that the Flickr API will send back for a couple of API methods (usually the responses are much longer, I'm abbreviating here to the interesting stuff (for example, you'll always get a `{ stat: 'ok' }` value for successful queries, but I don't include that here):

#### flickr.photosets.getList

    {
      photosets: {
        photoset: [
          { id: '72147630888316081', primary: '7500858540', secret: '3bedf92dec', server: '8214', farm: 9,
            photos: 3, videos: '0', title: { _content: '20120716 Iceland - Reykjavik' },
            description: { _content: 'flickr-store' }, needs_interstitial: 0, visibility_can_see_set: 1,
            count_views: '0', count_comments: '0', can_comment: 1,
            date_create: '1344024608', date_update: '1344024918' },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }

#### flickr.photos.search

    {
      photos: {
        photo: [
          { id: '7500858540', owner: '33947520@N00', secret: 'f38df12d5c',
            server: '8014', farm: 9, title: 'flickr-store',
            ispublic: 0, isfriend: 0, isfamily: 0 }
        ],
        ...
      }
    }

#### flickr.test.login

    {
      user: { id: '33947520@N00', username: { _content: 'audiere' } },
      stat: 'ok'
    }

## Development

Fixes are totally welcome! In the master branch, even! Just use sane formatting (like what jsbeautifier.org uses, but with 2-space indents, not 4).

## Dependencies

Just one dependency: [form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data). This is just for the uploads. It works awesomely, only takes about three lines to use. felixge is the author of (node-formidable)[https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable], which is another great form parsing library.

## Related

The node-flickr rewrite was all just to support my (Flickr Backup Script)[https://github.com/chbrown/flickr-backup], which is a script to automatically backup a directory of directories full of pictures as sets of photos to Flickr (since Pro accounts have unlimited storage). There are lots more examples in that code, too.
